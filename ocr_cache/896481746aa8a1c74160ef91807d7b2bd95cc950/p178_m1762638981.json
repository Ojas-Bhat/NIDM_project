The Organization Assignment List (IRS 003) provides IRS personnel with information on the units that are\ncurrently activated and the names of personnel staffing each position/unit. It is used to complete the Incident\nOrganization Chart (IRS 007) which is posted on the Incident Command Post display. An actual organization will be\nincident or event-specific. Not all positions need to be filled. Some blocks may contain more than one name.
