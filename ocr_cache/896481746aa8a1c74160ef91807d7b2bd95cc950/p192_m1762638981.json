{"text": "IRS 007\nIncident Organization Chart\n\nPurpose. The Incident Organization Chart (IRS 007) provides a visual wall chart depicting the IRS organization position\nassignments for the incident. The IRS 007 is used to indicate what IRS organizational elements are currently activated\nand the names of personnel staffing each element. An actual organization will be event-specific. The size of the\norganization is dependent on the specifics and magnitude of the incident and is scalable and flexible. Personnel\nresponsible for managing organizational positions are listed in each box as appropriate.\n\nPreparation. The IRS 007 is prepared by the Resources Unit Leader and reviewed by the Incident Commander.\nComplete only the blocks where positions have been activated, and add additional blocks as needed, especially for\nAgency Representatives and all Operations Section organizational elements. For detailed information about positions,\nconsult the IRS Field Operations Guide (or 2010 IRS Guidelines). The IRS 007 is intended to be used as a wall-size chart\nand printed on a plotter for better visibility. A chart is completed for each operational period, and updated when\norganizational changes occur.\n\nDistribution. The IRS 007 is intended to be wall mounted at Incident Command Posts and other incident locations as\nneeded, and is not intended to be part of the Incident Action Plan (IAP). All completed original forms must be given to the\nDocumentation Unit.\n\nNotes:\n\n* The IRS 007 is intended to be wall mounted (printed on a plotter).
