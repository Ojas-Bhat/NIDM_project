{"text": "Air Pollution and Public Health Emergencies\n\nAverage annual PM levels in high-income countries are typically low (<35 ug/m\u2019),\nwhile the PM concentrations in medium to low-income countries frequently exceed\nWHO air quality standards (Anenberg et al., 2019). Even in less polluted regions,\nspikes in ambient PM concentration are associated with various disease burdens,\npremature mortality, morbidity, reduced life expectancy, etc. (Croft et al., 2017,\nLuben et al., 2017; Balakrishnan, 2019). Poor fuel quality, high traffic density, a large\nproportion of old vehicles, poor road infrastructure and inadequate inspection and\nmaintenance programs, are some of the major causes of deteriorating urban air\nquality.\n\nThe WHO scientists also believe that global warming could lead to malaria, yellow\nfever, bone loss, respiratory diseases and other diseases. The proliferation of such\ninfections is growing further in warm and humid environments as pathogens often live\nunder such climatic conditions. Understanding of the geographical distribution of\ndiseases for the health planning of each country is required to notify the regulators of\nthe situation of each disease in the world and to include the necessary health\ninitiatives for residents in their health policies as well (Javadinejad et al., 2020).\n\nAsia is home to many extremely polluted cities in the world. South Asia is experiencing\nseverely degraded air quality, with particulate matter less than 2.5 um (PM,,)\nreaching unprecedented high levels.", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:09:06.250541"}
