{"text": "Air Pollution and Public Health Emergencies\n\nDelhi-based \u2018Chakr Innovation\u2019 curbs air pollution with the world's first retro-fit\nemission control device for diesel generators. The device captures around 90% of\nparticulate matter emissions from the exhaust smoke from the generators without\ncompromising on energy efficiency. Moreover, the diesel soot captured from the\nexhaust is afterward converted into ink and paint. Similarly, \u2018Cellzyme Biotech\u2019 from\nCoimbatore, Tamil Nadu, is another enterprise dedicated to combating air pollution\nby using an engineered enzyme to make antibiotics at room temperature, without\nusing solvents - which are a major contributor to air pollution.\n\nAll the necessary mitigation measures need to be implemented through effective and\nefficient implementation of air quality management to maintain acceptable urban air\nquality. Figure 11 shows the five key points that every city or state needs to learn to\ncombat air pollution.\n\nFigure 11 Five key lessons cities/states need to learn to combat air pollution\n\n6. Existing policies\n\nThere are numerous policies and programs to address the air pollution problem that\nhas been introduced across the world. However, like any other policy indicator, the\nperformance and effectiveness of these programs have been dependent on\ncooperation and coordination among different stakeholders.\n\nEmergency measures that have been taken under the Graded Response Action Plan\n(GRAP) of the Indian government suggested that if the air quality falls in moderate to\npoor category then banning garbage burning in landfills and enforcing all pollution\ncontrol regulations in brick kilns and industries would be implemented.
