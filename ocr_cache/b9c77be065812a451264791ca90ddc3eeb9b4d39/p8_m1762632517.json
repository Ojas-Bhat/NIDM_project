It is considered as the 5\"\nhighest-ranking risk factor for mortality, worldwide, accounting for about one out\nof every nine deaths per year. Globally, due to rapid industrialization,\nurbanization and population growth, the natural atmosphere is perturbed by\nincreased air pollution. It creates smog and acid rain, causes cancer, respiratory\ndiseases, depletion of the ozone layer and also contributes to global warming. In\nrecent years, air pollution has become a growing concern, with a rising number of\nsevere accidents in many cities around the world. Sudden and severe air pollution\nincidents are causing disaster-like conditions that are causing an urgent public\nhealth emergency. It is high time to think about our actions and move to new\nsustainable environmentally friendly technologies to solve the air pollution\nproblems. There is an urgent need that sudden air pollution management should\nbe implemented into state and city planning processes.\n\nKeywords: Air Quality; Climate Change; Disasters; Air Pollution; Human Health;\nPublic Health Emergency", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:08:49.755983"}
