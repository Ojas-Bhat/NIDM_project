During any disaster, air quality\nmanagement is dependent on the local community preparedness\nand external aid. Air pollution can also lead to disasters and\ndisasters can trigger air pollution as well. In both the cases human\nhealth and the environment would be affected.\n\nNow, it is not possible to perceive air pollution as an isolated environmental\nproblem. It is high time that sudden air pollution management should be\nimplemented into state and city planning processes. Hence, there is an urgent\nneed to respond to the situation. There is also the requirement of effective\nrepresentation and well-timely dissemination of air quality information, use of\naccurate and complex inferences to make significant implementation in air\nquality-related policy decisions.\n\n| complement Prof. Anil K. Gupta and the HER-CAP project team for this\nimportant contribution. | also thank WHO India for supporting this endeavor. The\nefforts of the authors are praiseworthy, as they meticulously brought in the\ncontext of this thematic paper which covers all these existing and forthcoming\nair-quality problems and their mitigation measures and resilience policy.\n\n/Dkhrined\n\n(Manoj Kumar Bindal)\n\nea", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:08:44.098631"}
