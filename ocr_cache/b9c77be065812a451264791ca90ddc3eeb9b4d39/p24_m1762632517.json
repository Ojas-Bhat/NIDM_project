{"text": "Air Pollution and Public Health Emergencies\n\n7. Conclusion & Recommendation\n\nAir pollution cannot be considered an isolated environmental concern, as it is now\nbecoming a major public health emergency. It is high time that air pollution control\nand management should become a part of state and city planning processes. The high\nburden of death and disease due to air pollution and its associated substantial adverse\neconomic impact from the loss of output could impede India\u2019s goal of becoming a $5\ntrillion economy by 2024. Successful reduction of air pollution in India through state-\nspecific strategies could lead to substantial benefits for both the health of the\npopulation and the economy. Collaboration and coordination at all levels of\ngovernment are very much important for the effective implementation of various air\npollution-related judicial orders, policies, guidelines and crisis management plans.\nThere is an immense need for an integrated framework for dealing with air pollution\nas a disaster during emergencies. In India and other developing countries, there is an\nutmost requirement of an integrated framework where all governing and regulatory\nbodies should work together to curb air pollution emergencies.\n\nReferences\n\ne Amato F., Cassee F.R., vanderGon H.A.C.D., Gehrig R., Gustafsson M., Hafner W.,\nHarrison R.M., Jozwicka M., Kelly F.J., Moreno T., Prevot A.S.H., Schaap M., Sunyer\nJ., Querol X.
