The major issues of\nurban floods, however, started arising in the 21* century and gradually amplified\nwith urbanisation. The frequency of urban floods across the world started\nincreasing resulting in heavy loss and damage. There have been 3,600 cases of\nurban flooding in the United States as reported by the National Weather Service\nbetween 1993 and 2017 (Poon, 2018). Illinois alone has suffered a loss of 2.3 billion\nUSD between 2007 to 2014 (Grabar, 2019). The Hull Flood of 2007, Newcastle Flood\nof 2012, Ireland Flood of 2012-13 and Cumbria Floods of 2017 are a few of the\ncatastrophic urban floodings in Europe. In Asia, almost every city of the continent is\nprone to urban floods because of their climatic conditions and topographical\ncharacteristics. Asian megacities like Bangkok, Manila, Guangzhou, Dhaka, Ho Chi\nMinhfF City, Jakarta and Mumbai are extremely vulnerable to frequent flooding.\nThe Queensland Flooding of 2011 and Townsville Floods of 2019 are major events of\nurban flooding in Australia in the previous decade.", "ts": "2025-11-08T19:55:05.234195"}
