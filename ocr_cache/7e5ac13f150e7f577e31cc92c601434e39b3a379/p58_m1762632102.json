{"text": "Chapter 5\n\nThe flood-affected areas were sanitised by more than 250 MT of bleaching powder\nsupplied by the Government and NGOs. The volunteers of NGOs and Residential\nWelfare Associations contributed to the door-to-door distribution of relief\nmaterials and applying bleaching powder in the flood-affected areas. There was no\ndelay in the distribution of perishable items to the victims resulting in little\nwastage.\n\nFigure 5.11: Distribution of Relief materials by Volunteers of NGOs and Residential Welfare Associations\nSource: (GCC, 2017)\n\n5.4 SHORT-TERM RECOVERY\n5.4.1Clearance of Garbage\n\nThe immediate concern after the relief and rescue was the restoration of the\nservices. One of the major challenges was the clearance of the garbage from the\ncity that got accumulated during the floods. The GCC mobilised 16,111 sanitary\nworkers and labourers with 675 lorries and 100 JCBs were mobilized from other\nlocal bodies along with its equipment and human resources for clearance of\ngarbage. The residents throwing a huge quantity of damaged household\narticles/debris on roads/streets daily was adding to the already accumulated\ngarbage heap which created a serious challenge for the Corporation. Despite the\nchallenges, the GCC managed to clear 2.2 Lakhs MT of garbage/debris at the rate of\n8,148MT perday (GCC, 2017).\n\na\n=\nm\nZz\nZz\n>\n7m\n_\n(S}\niS)\noO\nho\n=<\nor", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:02:44.698287"}
