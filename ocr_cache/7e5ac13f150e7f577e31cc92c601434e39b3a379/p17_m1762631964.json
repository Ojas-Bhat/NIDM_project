This is diminishing the natural storage capacity of\nthe soil and alters the existing hydrological cycle often increasing the surface\nrunoffs. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the\nvolumes in case of urban floods can increase by upto 6 times while the peaks from\n\nPRE-DKRASTSS DPS SCE AR TROANESATION SCENARIO\n\n1 engele lee\nstorey\n\nooh eA bee\npare cere, abe\n\ni!\n\nee ee\n\nepee ee oy te | ivy |\n\nEva ethene\n\nSe td\n\nbp \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 |\n\nated on) sae ge\n\noH /\n\nFigure 1.2: Water balance characteristics in an urban watershed\nSource: (WMO; Global Water Partnership, 2012)", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:00:13.425126"}
