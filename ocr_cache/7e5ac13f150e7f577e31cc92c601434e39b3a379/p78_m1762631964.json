{"text": "future flood risk scenarios should be projected with sensitivity to Climate\nChange and highlighting the problem areas faced during the previous floods.\n\n\u00b0 Climate Change Considerations for Design and Maintenance of Urban\nDrainage Infrastructure: Urban drainage infrastructures should be designed\nkeeping into account the predicted aspects of climate change (Arnbjerg-\nNielsen, et al., 2013)(Mailhot & Duchesne, 2010). Design and maintenance\nguidelines should be revised and redrafted taking into the impacts of climate\nchange (Djordjevic , Butler, Gourbesville, Mark, & Pasche, 2011).\n\ne Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) Measures: WSUD measures have\nbecome popular in the recent decade. Some of the popular WSUD measures\nare reducing or limiting inflow (Djordjevic\u2019, Butler, Gourbesville, Mark, &\nPasche, 2011), increasing surface storage or storage at sources (Mailhot &\nDuchesne, 2010), better design and deployment of surface flow features\n(Djordjevic\u2019 , Butler, Gourbesville, Mark, & Pasche, 2011) and disconnecting\nthe extremely impervious area from the water flow pathways (Mailhot &\nDuchesne, 2010).\n\ne Flood Resilience Measures for buildings: Sustainable measures\nincorporated to reduce the impacts of flooding into the building fabric,\nfixtures and fittings can be considered as resilience measures (Djordjevic\u2019 ,\nButler, Gourbesville, Mark, & Pasche, 2011). Careful detailing of the property\nand its surroundings such as flooring height, entrance details, steps,\ndriveway slopes, etc. can be used to achieve flood resilience (Djordjevic ,\nButler, Gourbesville, Mark, & Pasche, 2011).\n\n\u00b0 Real-Time Urban Flood Information Systems: The real-time warning system\nmight benefit municipal bodies and other agencies for processing rainfall\ndata and finally passing it to the public (Djordjevic\u2019, Butler, Gourbesville,\nMark, & Pasche, 2011).\n\n\u00b0 Creating awareness among communities and different stakeholders: The\nresidents of the city are equally responsible for such a catastrophic event.\nThe communities should be aware of the environmental risks and challenges\nand should not compromise with the regulations for self-interests. The real-\nestate builders and developers must also put a conscious effort to implement\nmitigation and prevention measures in the construction of their projects.\n\nThe current scenario of increasing urban floods in the country calls for the on-\nground implementation of a prevention-based approach of disaster management\ninstead of a relief-based approach. The above measures should be adopted in every\nurban area for building and strengthening flood resilience in the country. While\nrisk-sensitive development is imperative, the role of individual citizens in\napparently unrelated efforts like rainwater harvesting, waste segregation,\nrecycling of waste etc. would also contribute significantly towards mitigation\nmeasures for urban floods.\n\na\n=\nm\nZz\nZz\n=\n=\nail\n(S}\niS)\noO\nN\n=\nom", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:01:14.055826"}
