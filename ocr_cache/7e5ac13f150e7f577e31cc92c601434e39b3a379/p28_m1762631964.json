Some of i\nthe reservoirs like Poondi a as = i ar\nreservoir, Cholavaram lake, Red Se SS\nhills lake and Chembarambakkam\ntank also act as a major source of\ndrinking water of the city.

Nagar, West\nMambalam, Anna Nagar, Villivakkam, Perambur and Virugambakkam. The\nriverbanks and coasts in the city such as Tiruvanmiyur, Adyar, Kottivakkam, St.\nThomas Mount, George Town, Tondiarpet have sandy soil while few parts of the city\nlike Guindy, Perungudi, Velachery, Adambakkam and a part of Saidapet have hard\nsedimentary rocks. The rainwater runoff usually percolates very quickly in the\nsandy soil areas while the runoff in clayey and hard rocks percolates very slowly and\nare held for a longer duration. The slow runoff percolation contributes to partial\ninundation in several parts of the city.\n\na\n=\nm\nZz\nZz\n>\n7m\n_\n(S}\niS)\noO\nho\n=<\nor", "ts": "2025-11-08T20:00:58.944079"}
