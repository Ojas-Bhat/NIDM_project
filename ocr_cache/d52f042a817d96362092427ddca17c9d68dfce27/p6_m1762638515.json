Hence, it is finding an increasingly central position on the\ninternational agenda as well.\n\nExtreme weather events such as severe floods and drought\nhave claimed thousands of lives during the last few years and\nhave adversely affected the lives of millions and cost significantly\nin terms of economic losses and damage to property. Both floods\nand droughts increase the risk of vector-borne and food-borne diseases. Any\nincrease in frequency and severity of these extreme climate events also leads to\ncause population displacement. These displaced people are also likely to face\nvarious health consequences like traumatic, infectious, nutritional,\npsychological, and others.\n\nThis thematic paper has been developed under the project \u201cHealth Adaptation\nand Resilience: Advancing Strategic Knowledge and Capacities\u201d (HER-CAP) with\nthe support of World Health Organization (WHO) India, describing the process of\nextreme weather events like floods and drought, its current and future impacts on\nhuman health and how we can reduce those adverse impacts by various mitigation\n\nand adaptation strategies.\nKate\n\n(Prof. Anil K Gupta)\n\niti", "ts": "2025-11-08T21:48:56.266635"}
