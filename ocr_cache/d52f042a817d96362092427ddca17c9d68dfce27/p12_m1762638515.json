{"text": "Water Related Disasters (Floods & Drought)\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWater is indispensable for every living organism. Nevertheless, in some situations\nwater may produce undesirable impacts on human beings or the environment and\neven pose a threat to life (Grayman, 2011).When these impacts rise to some high\nundefined level we designate the event as a disaster. Likewise, water-related\ndisasters may rise primarily as a result of surplus water such as floods, flashfloods,\nand dam - failure or by scanty water leading to droughts, difficulties in public\nsupply of potable water, impacts on agriculture or industries. Changing climate\nand global warming are expected to result in increased frequency and intensity of\nfloods and drought. The increase of these events is already evident in many places\nacross the globe, where majority of states are still ill-prepared to respond and\nmanage them (Water and Disaster Risk, 2015).Figure 1 and Figure 2 represents the\nnumber of droughts and floods affected countries across the globe.\n\nfeo eet wi\n\nages ee ce; CRED 20145.
