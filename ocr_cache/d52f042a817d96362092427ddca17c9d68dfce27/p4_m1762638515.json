A land of such diverse topography\nand microclimates, it is exposed to a wide spectrum of climate\nrisks. India's vulnerability is in part due to its sensitivity to a wide\nrange of climate impacts including droughts, floods, storms, and\nextreme temperatures. Droughts occur less frequently, but\nimpact the highest number of people in the country whereas floods are the most\neconomically damaging climate impact, costing more than all other disaster\nevents combined.\n\nThis paper focuses on understanding the vulnerability of India to two\nprominent climate extremes that India is affected by repeatedly: drought and\nfloods and also presents growing threats to public health security. Vector-borne\ndiseases such as Malaria, diarrhea, dengue and malnutrition are major public\nhealth problems. Any further increase, as projected in weather-related disasters\nand related health effects, may cripple the already inadequate public health\ninfrastructure in the country.\n\nHence, there is an urgent need to respond to the situation. Response options\nto protect health from effects of climate change include mitigation, adaptation as\nwell as preparedness, which can significantly reduce the risks of extreme weather\n\nevents.\nSTOKR ink\n\n(Manoj Kumar Bindal)", "ts": "2025-11-08T21:48:49.690652"}
