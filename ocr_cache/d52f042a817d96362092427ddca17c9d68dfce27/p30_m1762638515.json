Large scale medical stores from where these\nmaterials can be procured must be pre-identified.\n\n4.5 National Health Adaptation Plan for climate change related health\nissues:\n\nANational Health Adaptation Plan (NHAP) has been drafted to address the climate\nchange related health illnesses. It addresses that hospitals must nominate a\nsuitable officer for coordinating management for disaster related casualties.\nContingency plans should be made ready for providing additional beds. It should\nalso ensure safe water supply and clean food availability along with maintenance\nof hygiene and sanitation by proper bio-waste disposal. Water testing and food\ninspection is required to be carried out regularly to prevent outbreak of any\nepidemic.\n\n4.6 Climate-resilient water resource management:\n\nClimate-resilient water resource management is a potentially powerful process\nto achieve local, and possibly global, food security (encompassing food\nproduction, preparation distribution, consumption and waste). On the mitigation\nside, interventions related to the increased utilization of solar pumps, practicing\nconservation agriculture to improve soil organic matter (needed for the soil to\nretain water), reducing post-harvest losses and food waste, and transforming\nwaste into a source of nutrients or biofuels/biogas can address food security and\nclimate change.\n\nPN", "ts": "2025-11-08T21:51:05.212877"}
