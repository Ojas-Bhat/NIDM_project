{"text": "Water Related Disasters\n(Floods & Drought)\n\nImplications for Health Adaptation & Resilience\n\nAbstract\n\nFloods and droughts are expected to increase with climate change and global\nwarming. Many places across the globe, these are already taking place and the\nworld is ill-prepared to respond to such disasters. In India, due to different\nclimatic and rainfall patterns in different regions, some parts are suffering\ndevastating floods, whereas, other parts are suffering drought at the same time.\nThis paper explores the nature of water-related disasters, flood and drought, in\nseveral dimensions; provide an insight on the implications of such disasters on\nhuman health, healthcare resources and food security. It also discusses that there\nis a need to address knowledge and policy gaps, strengthen institutional\ncoordination and participation, and implementation of new activities to prevent\nwater related disasters as well as reduce their impact through post disaster\nmanagement policies. Floods and Droughts are a common occurrence and their co-\nexistence poses a potent threat to human and environment health, which may be\neliminated but need to be managed.\n\nKeywords: Climate Change; Disasters; Floods; Droughts, Health Resilience;\nWater-borne Disease; Vector-borne Disease", "ts": "2025-11-08T21:49:07.431502"}
