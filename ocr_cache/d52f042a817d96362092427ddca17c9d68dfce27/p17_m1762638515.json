{"text": "Water Related Disasters (Floods & Drought)\n\ndeficits etc. The gradually developing nature and long duration of drought,\ntogether with a large variability of impacts beyond direct and visible agricultural\nlosses, typically make the task of quantifying drought impact challenging\n(MIDIMAR, 2015).\n\nDrought has been recognized as a complex hazard owing to its slow-onset\ncharacteristic with widespread risk and cascading impacts often accumulating\nslowly over an extended period. Drought effects are non-structural and can\nspread over large geographic areas and temporal scales with impacts moving more\nstrongly the secondary effects like lost livelihoods, forced migration, top soil and\nnutrient erosion than in the primary effects. Although droughts have no damage to\nstructures, however, their economic cost in direct and indirect terms could be\ndevastating.", "ts": "2025-11-08T21:49:38.407770"}
